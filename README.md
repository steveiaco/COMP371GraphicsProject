# COMP371GraphicsProject
For this project, we developed a procedurally generated three-dimensional world. Our world is infinite in size and made up of diverse biomes each with their own unique characteristics. While not a game, our project can be explored either with a free-roaming first-person camera, a grounded first-person camera, or a cinematic spline-bound camera.

Other notable features of the project include dynamic lighting and a skybox that simulates day and night cycles. The code was built on top of the Assignment 1 framework and requires no additional dependencies.

Obvious inspirations for our project included games like Minecraft, Rust and No Manâ€™s Sky, that generate their worlds procedurally. However, due to time constraints, our project includes very little gameplay.
